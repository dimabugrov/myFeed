# Roadmap and Info
myFeed is under an enormous rewrite right now. After a few weeks 2.0 Version will be finished and published to the Windows Store where you'll be able to get it for free. This update is supposed to be faster, cleaner, brighter and less buggy. Application will be rewritten according to SOLID principles, that means that development would become easier and updates will be published more often :P
